# Dual-Parameter Retinal Biomarker Analysis: Integrating Structural and Vascular Changes for Cardiovascular Disease Screening

## üìå Overview
This web application analyzes retinal fundus images to predict cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk by integrating **vascular biomarkers** (AV ratio, fractal dimension), **structural biomarkers** (cup-to-disc ratio), and **13 ophthalmic biomarkers**. The system employs state-of-the-art deep learning models to automate biomarker extraction and applies a rule-based system for risk classification.

Our approach leverages the retina as a non-invasive "window" to assess systemic vascular health, providing early detection capabilities for CVD risk factors that may not be apparent through traditional screening methods.

## üìä Risk Classification System
Our system uses a rule-based approach to classify CVD risk by integrating multiple biomarkers:

### High Risk Indicators:
1. **Presence of any high-risk ophthalmic biomarker**:
   - BDR, PDR, CNV, AR, HTR, CRVO, BRVO, HCRVO, RAO, BRAO, MA

2. **Abnormal vascular or structural parameters**:
   - AV Ratio: < 0.67 or > 0.75
   - Cup-to-Disc Ratio (CDR): > 0.6
   - Fractal Dimension (FD): < 1.3

### Risk Calculation Logic:
```
IF any high-risk ophthalmic biomarker is present:
    CVD_Risk = HIGH
ELSE IF (AVR is abnormal) OR (CDR > 0.6) OR (FD < 1.3):
    CVD_Risk = HIGH
ELSE:
    CVD_Risk = LOW
```
